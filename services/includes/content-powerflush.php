		<p>If you're looking for a power flush in <?php echo $locationLabel . " " . $postCode; ?>, then give us a call at Serviceteam on 020 7837 4914. We can have a local qualified plumber to power flush your radiators today!</p>
		<p>Power flushing your central heating system is a great way to remove the nasty debris and sludge that circulates inside it. It can make a boiler less reliable and less efficient. We have the right equipment and engineers to make this a simple and stress free undertaking. Most people come to us looking for power flushes because it's a stipulation of their boiler insurance. In that case, you'll be glad to know that we guarantee to beat any written quotation from our friends at British Gas for powerflushing!</p>
    <p>
      What's more, get a power flush from Serviceteam and we'll install a Magnaclean magnetic cleaning system for just £150! That way you'll probably never need a power flush again.

    <h1>How does the dirt get into the heating system in the first place?</h1>
    <p>
      Central heating systems accumulate limescale, dirt, corrosion and rusting over time. The dirt comes from the inside of the radiators, pipes and boiler itself. Power flushing removes this build up from the system, thereby increasing the efficiency of the system by up to 25% and reducing your fuel bills. - <a href="#">Click here for more details on Power Flushing</a>
